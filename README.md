# Mario VGA â€” Retro Platformer on FPGA ðŸŽ®
This project is a hardware implementation of a retro-style platformer game, inspired by classic 8-bit Mario and built using Verilog. The game was deployed on the **Nexys 4 DDR FPGA** and rendered directly to a VGA monitor.

## ðŸ›  Features
- VGA output using 640x480 resolution at 60Hz
- Sprite animation and movement logic built in Verilog
- Collision detection with platforms and obstacles
- Game physics (gravity, jumping, boundaries)

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay
Players can jump, move, and avoid obstacles using the Nexys 4. The goal is to navigate through a side-scrolling platformer level, collect coins, and avoid enemies. The game logic handles frame timing, player physics, and sprite positioning â€” all in hardware.
